# Tales of a System Call Spelunker - An Introductory Workshop for Stratoshark

These resources are part of a workshop delivered at Sharkfest 25 US, the Wireshark (and now Stratoshark) user's conference. This is meant to give people interested in the system call analysis possibilities of Stratoshark a leg up on this new tool.

## Useful Links

To complete the exercises in this repo, both Wireshark and Stratoshark are required.

You can download Wireshark from [wireshark.org](wireshark.org).

And you can download Stratoshark from [stratoshark.org](stratoshark.org).

Ahead of the official version 1 release of Stratoshark, it may be most useful to download the latest development build, which can be found [here](https://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/). Just navigate to your OS and grab the latest-created date.

And finally, any study of system calls requires a reference document for all the different system calls, at least until you can memorize all 456 of them. [This is the best reference I've found for those system calls](https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/).

## Conclusion

I truly hope this becomes a useful resource for people learning to use Stratoshark. If anything is unclear or you need help working through a problem, you can find me on the Wireshark Discord server. You can also find my contact information at [www.jeclark.net](www.jeclark.net).
